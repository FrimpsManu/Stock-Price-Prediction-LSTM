# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM 
 
This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict daily stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained on Tesla stock price data (from 2010 to 2023), sourced from Kaggle. By leveraging the power of LSTM, the project aims to predict future stock price movements based on historical patterns.


## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to use deep learning techniques to build a model that predicts stock prices, focusing on Tesla Inc. The model utilizes an LSTM network, which is particularly effective for time series forecasting. Stock prices exhibit temporal dependencies, making LSTM a good fit for this task.

The project involves:
- Collecting and preparing historical stock price data for Tesla (2010â€“2023) from Kaggle.
- Preprocessing the data (including normalization and transformation into a format suitable for LSTM training).
- Building and training an LSTM model to predict future stock prices.
- Visualizing the predictions and comparing them with actual values.

The Tesla stock price dataset typically includes the following key features:

    -Date: The specific day on which the stock price data was recorded.
    -Open: The price at which the stock opened at the beginning of the trading day.
    -Close: The price at which the stock closed at the end of the trading day.
    -Adj. Close: The adjusted closing price, which accounts for corporate actions such as stock splits, dividends, and other adjustments that may have occurred on that day.
    -High: The highest price the stock reached during the trading day.
    -Low: The lowest price the stock fell to during the trading day.

These features provide valuable insights into the stock's performance, trends, and volatility over time. They can be leveraged for various financial analyses, predictive modeling, and informed decision-making in the stock market.

    -Source code for the project stock_price_prediction.py
    -Python file for the core functionality

3. Requirements.txt
    -List of project dependencies README.md
    -Project description and instructions .gitignore
    -Gitignore to exclude unnecessary files
 

## Requirements 
 
To install the required dependencies, run the following command: 
 
pip install the libraries in the requirements.txt 

 
## Usage 
 
To run the stock price prediction model, use the following command: 
 
-python src/stock_price_prediction.py 

The script will load the Tesla stock price data (from 2010 to 2023), preprocess it, build the LSTM model, train it, and generate predictions for future stock prices.
